✅If you’ve got two #Katana inspired products under the same roof, you must match them. (No other options!)😎

✅Best Japanese watchmakers crafted my #GrandSeiko and talented Erhan Ozden did an amazing job on that bottle design for a brave brand called Kamiki, which uses “cedar wood casks” to mature this blended malt whisky.👌🥃
