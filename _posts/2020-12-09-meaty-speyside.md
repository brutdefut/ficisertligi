✅ -Meaty Speyside? 
-Make it double please! 🥃🥃

Craigellachie uses “worm tubs” to cool their spirits slowly and the result is oily, meaty character. 👊

I’m very excited and curious about a full bottle of #Craigellachie13 and can’t wait to taste/share it with my friends. 🥃🥃

Have a good week to you all! 🥃
