✅Too many recessions affected whisky industry in 19th and 20th century but Glenfarclas Family never gave up on their spirits and always said “No!” to the blends. 👊
Imho, 15 yo expression is one of the best sherried whiskies in the world, from the “Valley of the green Grassland” distillery. 🥃

✅Red fruits exploding, chocolate, raisins, cinnamon, oily, very slightly smoky, oaky and 46% abv gives amazing depth to this wonderfully balanced whisky. 🥃

✅Award-Winning #Glenfarclas15
