âœ…First NAS limited edition bottling from King Car Group, also the owners of the Kavalan. 
Master blender #IanChang and consultant Dr. #JimSwan (RIP) did great job on this one. ðŸ‘Š

âœ…Lime, mango, green apple, vanilla, caramel; really exotic on the nose. Nutty, peppery, slightly oily, warm and lingering. ðŸ¥ƒ

Have a lovely #Tuesday whisky friends! ðŸ¥ƒðŸ¥ƒ
